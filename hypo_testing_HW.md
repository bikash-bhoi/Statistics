#### Introduction

The [Köppen–Geiger climate classification system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Köppen_climate_classification) is a common climate classification system. It classifies the climate of a region using [3 letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Köppen_climate_classification#Meaning_of_symbols). The first represents the type of climate, the second indicates precipitation, and the third corresponds to temperature. For example, San Diego is classified as Bsh[[1\]](http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pics/kottek_et_al_2006.gif), where the B represents arid climate, s stand for dry summer, and h corresponds to hot. For the 3rd symbol to be h, the annual average temperature should be above 18ºC.

#### Dataset

We will use the [hourly weather](https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data/data) dataset to consider temperature changes in the city.

*Note that the temperatures given in the dataset is in Kelvin. To convert from Kelvin to ºC use [ºC]=[K]-273.15*
